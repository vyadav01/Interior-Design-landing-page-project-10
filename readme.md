Hello, I'm **Vikash Yadav** 

This project is a part of the **Full Stack Javascript** course by ineuron.ai. It is given by our instructor and mentor, **Hitesh** sir,  as an assignment.

In this project, I have learned about **CSS position property with pesudo element selectors and how work with SVG image**.

### **Time spent to finish it.**

It took me 8 hours to complete this project. (most of the time consumed to know how to work with SVG images.)
